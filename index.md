Besides this we have established a 10 height Cassurina hedge with about 3700 saplings to make up the western boundary. This hedge today has established itself as a 10 feet tall green screen.

>* Rain Water Harvesting has been planned along the entire 1800 odd feet - 40 wide drive way. This will not only improve the ground water charge, but will also help our bore well. The entire layout is VASTU complaint.
